Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.

- Seperate frontend and backend applications stitched together via
  `docker-compose` and an `NGINX` proxy.

- The application Url structure is as follows:
  http://localhost:8080/ -> React
  http://localhost:8080/{hash} -> Phoenix endpoint for redirect
  http://localhost:8080/api/links -> REST JSON endpoints via Phoenix

- `Frontend` application created with `create-react-app`
- `Backend` application created with Elixir Phoenix
- Datastore is `PostgreSQL`

- Each project directory has a `makefile` to facilitate local development and testing
  utilizing the template provided with the instructions.

- The `frontend` application consumes the `BACKEND_URL` ENV variable for local development
  and assumes relative in "production".

- The `backend` application serves no HTML and only has one non-JSON endpoint for redirects.
  This choice was made to avoid having to load JavaScript for a redirect.

- Validation happens in the `/api/links` POST endpoint for Url. It is also implemented
  in the form in the `frontend` app.  This is to prevent any bad actors hitting our API directly.

- Configuration done with ENV vars.

Further Improvements:
- Currently all builds are for development locally. Consideration for production would need to be added.

- Improve overall test coverage.
- Add e2e testing via Cypress.

- Improved validation and messaging for duplicate short links (the hash and the original Url)
- Improve testing of `frontend` for Accessiblity with `jest-axe`

- Improve integration testing with something like `Wallaby` on the backend for the Phoenix app.
- Improve doc tests in Phoenix application.
